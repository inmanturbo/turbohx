## Usage

This package extends [laravel/folio](https://github.com/laravel/folio) to add some extra features like allowing `POST`, `PATCH`,`PUT` and `DELETE`, mostly to support using [htmx](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx) or perhaps [alpine](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). See <https://github.com/laravel/folio/issues/106>

Also allows for a wilcard file to work in place of an index php. As descrive here: <https://github.com/laravel/folio/pull/119>
